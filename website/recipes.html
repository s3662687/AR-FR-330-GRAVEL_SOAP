    </p>

    <h1> Ingredients </h1>
    <p> 
      2 cups fresh breadcrumbs <br>
      1/3 cup finely grated parmesan cheese <br>
      1 tablespoon finely grated lemon rind <br>
      2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves <br>
      1 teaspoon Garlic Powder <br>
      1/2 cup plain flour <br>
      1 egg <br>
      1 tablespoon milk <br>
      550g chicken breast schnitzel (uncrumbed) <br>
      Vegetable oil, for shallow-frying <br>
    </p>
    <br>

    <h1> Method </h1>
    <p>
      Step 1
Combine breadcrumbs, parmesan, lemon rind, parsley and garlic powder on a plate. Season with salt and pepper. Place flour on a plate. Whisk egg and milk together in a shallow bowl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Step 2
      Coat 1 piece of chicken in flour, shaking off excess. Dip in egg mixture. Coat in breadcrumb mixture. Place on a plate. Repeat with remaining chicken, flour, egg mixture and breadcrumb mixture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Step 3
      Heat oil in a frying pan over medium-high heat. Cook chicken, in batches, for 4 to 5 minutes each side or until golden and cooked through. Transfer to a plate lined with paper towel to drain. Serve.

This was really good. Made it for my family last night and my son who is a picky eater LOVED it. Will definitely make again. <br>

      Everyone loved the way the lemon cut through the fatty fried goodness and how the succulent morsels of chicken just melt in your mouth. This is my new go-to Schnitzel recipe (sorry Mom, even though I know deep down you're not). <br>
