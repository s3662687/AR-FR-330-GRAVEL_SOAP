        <h1> Project Progress </h1>

        <h2> Description </h2>
        <p>
            How it began <br><br>
            We were quick to decide on a topic for our project, already sure we wanted to make a recipe related website targeted towards students. 
            As students ourselves, we chose a recipe-based website as we knew how hard it could be to cook your own healthy meals when first living away from home. 
            We felt a website dedicated to providing simple and affordable recipes, as well as the tools needed to start turning home cooking into a habit would be useful for students and others alike. 
            From here we discussed what the main features of our website would be, however creating the final concrete design of our site’s functionality wouldn’t be as quick a process as choosing out initial topic.
        </p>

        <p>
            How it progressed <br><br>
            As a group we planned what kind of features we wanted on the site, and while we quickly came up with a rough plan, many of our initial features were ambiguous and vague. 
            We had our core idea of what kinds of recipes there would be, and how users would be able to search up recipes for dishes they desired, but beyond this we struggled to tie down concrete ideas that related to our design. 
            This was especially true for our extended viable features. 
            <br><br>
            After meeting with our tutor, we realised we needed something more innovative in our design to help it stand out. Taking our tutor’s advice, we decided to try implementing a virtual reality feature. 
            This would allow users to inspect a 3D model of the dish they planned to make and serve as an innovative extended feature. 
            We soon created a list of each MVF and EVF we planned to create on trello, creating an individual card for each feature where group members could add ideas for the features design and implementation. 
            However, as our project progress, some of our initial features came under question, some too vague, and others simply too unrealistic to implement.  
        </p>

        <p>
            How progress compared to our plan <br><br>
            After looking into VR, we quickly realised the troubles in implementing VR onto our site. Our group had no experience in 3D modelling, or in creating 3D objects compatible with a website and VR. 
            The relevance of VR itself came into question, as being able to view meals in 3D space was more of a gimmick than innovation and had little to no relevance to the general theme of our website or target audience. 
            However, we didn’t want to abandon the feature all together, and instead altered the VR idea into something more relevant and tangible. 
            We liked the idea of being able to view dishes, so instead of 3D models we designed a feature where users can share images of food they have made instead. 
            Other users can comment on these images, with the goal being creating a sense of community on the site.
            <br><br>
            Without VR we didn’t have any innovative features that would help our website stand out. 
            To counter this, we designed a feature that would allow users to enter any ingredients they already had in house, and then the website would provide recipes using only those ingredients. 
            This way users wouldn’t need to go out and buy new ingredients. This replaced a ‘Resources’ feature that aimed to provide further resources to users such as other recipes, recipe books, and cooking websites and YouTube channels. 
            Instead of removing this feature all together we combined it with the ‘Tutorials’ feature as both were functionally similar. 
            <br><br>
            With these changes we had a more concrete plan to follow. We assigned members to each feature, working on our respective features independently with the plan to combine our features into one website later.
        </p>
        <h2> Scope Creep</h2>
        <P>
            While we defined our features, our scope wasn’t as concrete. We had initially planned a fully functioning website, however this scope quickly got reduced. <br> <br>
            Originally we planned to create our own tutorial videos and recipes, however with the time needed to create enough original content compared to actually developing the functionality of each feature, we had to reduce our scope in this area to more of a demonstration level. 
            We plan to incorporate only about 10 different recipes, all of which sourced from online. And while we did create some of our own tutorial videos, we will only incorporate a handful of functioning tutorials with these videos included. Any other images and footage will be from online sources. 
        </P>
        <h2> Progress </h2>
		<h3>Review</h3>
			<p>Function was completed within the estimated due date of our timetable</p>
		<h3>Pantry Recipe Maker</h3>
			<p>Function was not completed within the estimated due date of our timetable. The function required a lot of changes, which included:</p>
			<li>Not using MySQL for it to present the ingredients</li>
			<li>Not using PHP for it to present the ingredients</li>
			<p>This was again, due to coding experience even though the time estimation of learning the code was 15 hours. 
				The amount of time needed to complete the function was increased as a result.</p>
        <h2> Testing </h2>

	       <p> No external testing performed on all MVFs. </p>
		<h3>Review & Pantry Recipe Maker</h3>
			<p>The Pantry Recipe and Review function was tested by local hosting the .html and .php files. <br>
			This includes:</p>
			<li>All hyperlinks were able to be loaded</li>
			<li>Any form validation was functional</li>
			<li>Php functions and scripts are called and tested</li>
			<li>.css files are checked to see if there are any visual errors.</li>
			<p>Debugging was conducted by local hosting the files, but was very limited due to limited knowledge of error message meanings within Visual Studio Code.<br>
			What I would do differently was to have all members included within the debugging stage to get more different perspectives of how to debug an error within the code, as well as organise the code to reduce errors.</p>
	
	

        <h2> Tools and Technologies </h2>

        <h3> Collaborative Workspaces </h3>

			<p>Trello<br>
			Trello allows for different tasks to easily be managed and accessed by group members on cards. 
			Members can add and edit tasks and communicate through comments. 
			Trello board has been implemented on teams so all team members can view the board through teams without needing to view an external app.
			</p>

			<p>GitHub<br>
			GitHub allows for file sharing and version management between members. 
			Every member is able to upload files to GitHub to be previewed or downloaded. A link to access GitHub is available to all group members on teams.
			</p>

			<p>Google docs<br>
			Google docs allows members to import, create, edit and update documents and spreadsheets in various fonts and file formats. 
			Different members can add and edit documents simultaneously, or whenever they are online. Allowing for collaborative work even with differing schedules.
			</p>

			<h3> Software and Resources </h3>

			<p>mySQL<br>
			MySQL is an open-source relational database management system. It allows for storing account information and works with PHP.
			</p>

			<p>Excel<br>
			Microsoft Excel allows for calculation, graphing tools, and pivot tables using spreadsheets. 
			It will be used to table task allocation and the estimated amount of time required for each task.
			</p>

			<h3> Tools </h3>

			<p>HTML5<br>
			HTML5 is a markup languages used for web development. It is responsible providing a structure and presenting contents on the web. 
			HTML5 is being used as it's one of the most common languages for web developement and all members have experience using it.
			</p>

			<p>CSS3<br>
			CSS is a stylesheet language thats compatible with html5. It is used to deal with presentation of a web page, essentially it is used to make a web page look pretty. 
			</p>

			<p>PHP<br>
			PHP is a server scripting language for web development. This is going to be used to handle account management in our project such as registration and login. 
			It is free and it can work with different database language such as MySQL.
