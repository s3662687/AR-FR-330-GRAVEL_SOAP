        <h2> Motivation </h2>
        <p>
            For many students cooking at home is rarely practical. 
            Shopping for fresh and healthy ingredients is not only time consuming but also expensive. 
            Trying to juggle healthy cooking and eating on top of the busy schedule of student life means many students turn to cheaper and unfortunately less healthy alternatives such as fast food.
            <br><br>
            We wanted to create a tool that would help students better plan and budget home cooking, so that making their own meals would become a habit rather than a chore.
            <br><br>
            So, we designed ‘Fruit Bowl’. A website designed to facilitate the learning of new cooking skills and sharing of simple and affordable recipes. 
            We hope these features will help enable students to cook at home who otherwise lacked the time, money, or know how to regularly cook before. 
        </p>

        <h2> Aim and Goals </h2>
        <p>
            Aim
            <br><br>
            We want to create a simple cooking assistant to inspire students to do their own home cooking more often. 
            Fruit bowl aims to help teach users basic culinary skills they may not already know or may have never been taught that will help them get started with cooking. 
            <br><br>
            We want to offer healthy, affordable, and simple recipes sorted by estimated price and cooking times so that students are not so intimidated by spending the time and money trying to plan out and cook at home. 
            The application will be a website with cross platform compatibility across all devices. Users can use it on the go on their phone while shopping for ingredients, or at home while preparing their meal. 
            Our aim is to make home cooking less of a challenge and more of a habit for struggling students.
        </p>
        <p>
            Goals
            <br><br>
            Search Function: This goal is about letting users search for a recipe by either entering the name of a dish they want to make or entering key words they want included in the search. 
            Optionally they can filter the search by price and cooking time. 
            Through an easy user interface, users should be able to locate a desired recipe and be taken to the recipe page where they can start cooking. 
            <br><br>
            Review System: This goal is about allowing users to rate and review recipes on the website. These are rated out of five stars and presented with each recipe so other users can see its reviews. 
            Each rating of a recipe will be calculated toward a community average rating which will be displayed on that recipe. 
            The ratings of a dish can be used to filter certain scores in or out of a search.
            <br><br>
            Tutorial Feature: This goal is about teaching users basic culinary skills that they can use to help improve their own cooking at home, or just to get them started with the basics. 
            Through videos, images, and written tutorials, users should be able to easily follow and understand each lesson to gradually improve their cooking.
            <br><br>
            Ingredient Function: This goal is about allowing users to find recipes based only on which ingredients they have in their kitchen. Users can compile a list of which ingredients they have available. 
            Then they get recipes that use only the ingredients provided by the user. 
            This allows users to quickly find a recipe they can make without needing to shop for new ingredients, helping save time and money.
        </p>
