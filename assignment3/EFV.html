                        Sally is having guests over for dinner and she's cooking. She looks up a recipe on her favourite recipe site and begins to cook.
                        Her guests arrive, but sally realises she followed the recipe too closley and only cooked enough for 1 person!
                        Later, sally is hosting another dinner party, but this time she uses Fruit Bath's ingredient scale.
                        She brings up her recipe and choice and sets the scale to match the number of guests. 
                        The website automatically adjusts the recipe to fit the number of dinner guests, changing the amount of ingredients, time, and budget.
                        This allows Sally to better plan and budget her cooking for the party ahead.
                        When the guests arrive Sally has cooked enough food to satisfy everyone at the table!

                    <h2> Explanation </h2>

                    Each recipe will have an ingredient scale attached.
                    After selecting a recipe users will be able to edit the ingredient scale.
                    <br><br>
                    The scale automatically edits the amount of ingredients required for a recipe, to account for any number of people a user is cooking for.
                    If the recipe is to be cooked for 4 people, the scale is set to 4 and the recipe will call for 4 times the amount of ingredients than without scale.
                    The scale will also change the estimated price and cooking time of each recipe.
