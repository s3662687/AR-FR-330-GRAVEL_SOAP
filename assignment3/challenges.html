                  This was especially true when due dates for other classes would near. Since our tutorial class was held friday afternoons, many of my assignments would be due that night.</td>

		      That caused some errors that were difficult to debug. Organisation was another aspect of the project that was difficult. 
		      I tend to forget many times to update my work progress on Trello and I have a tendency to not post incremental updates of my code on Github which is why my contributions count would be low at times.</td>

		      I underestimated how much time I needed to allocate in order to learn certain functions and constants of php which decreased the amount of time to code and make it function work.</td>

        <h3> What we would have changed </h3>
        <p>
            If we had realised the challenges involved in developing, managing, and uploading databases to a website we may have considered a different topic to do our project on.
            Having a topic that didn't rely so heavily on databases would've saved our group a lot of time in the long run, allowing us to focus more on the quality of each feature.
            However, due our lack of database knowledge, this assignment taught us a lot about PHP and databases.
            For that reason rather than abandoning databases all together, we may have just picked a project that wouldn't be as dependant on databases to function.
            <br><br>
            Throughout development which features we would implement frequently changed. As did our roles and which members worked on which features. 
            Because of our rapidly changing plans some members had more work than others, and so we frequently switched and swapped members around to balance workload.
            If we were to do the project again we would've dedicated more time to developing a concrete plan before hand that would've allowed our group to be more focused on each feature.
        </p>
        
        <h3> Was our timetable realistic </h3>
        <p>
            As reached the end of the semester and more and more due dates for different subjects grew closer, our team realised we wouldn't have as much time to dedicate to our project as we initially outlined in our estimation plan.
            Our time table ended up being unrealistic as we assigned more time for some features than we were realistically capable of doing. Several features were overestimated however, and actually took longer to develop than outlined.
            <br><br>
            These differences were mainly because of our inexperience with certain aspects of each feature such as databases, leading to under/overestimate aspects we wern't as knowledgeable about.
            We also started the actual development of our features a little later than intially planned. This lead to a few innacurate estimations as we hadn't actually got our hands dirty with the development of that feature yet to really grasp how short/long its development would take.
        </p>

        <h3> Did our tools and technologies work out as expected </h3>
        <p>
            Generally all our tools and technologies worked out as expected. <br>
            Our primary challange was with getting PHP and databases to work with aws as this wasn't a difficulty we anticpated. <br>
            In our assigned teams channel for some reason we couldnt record our meetings. To solve this we had to make a seperate channel for the sole purpose of recording meetings.
            However, this lead to the lose of some our meetings since we never able to record them, and caused difficulties later as we ended up using both channels for discussion.
            This left out discussions split over two different channels which caused some communication mishaps.
