					<td>Coding</td>
					<td>Testing</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Search Function</td>
					<td>The team lack of experience using PHP and SQL may take a while to bring up to scratch</td>
					<td>Research may take a while depending on what search function is chosen, whether they are building 
					themselves or using a built-in one</td>
					<td>Design for this may take a while as a sloppy search function, just look what happened to webcrawler</td>
					<td>Coding will be the most intensive part of this section as it will be linked to a database and the code function itself may need to be built </td>
					<td>Testing of the search function may take a while, putting in different error pushing keywords </td>
				</tr>
				
				<tr>
					<td>Introduction Tutorial</td>
					<td>This won't take too much of the majority of the time as it won't involve learning any intense code</td>
					<td>Research may take a while, depending on how many recipes are compiled</td>
					<td>Design shouldn't take too long, as it should just hold basic information</td>
					<td>Coding this won't take long since all it requires is HTML and CSS</td>
					<td>Error handling of this function will be the quickest as there should be no intricate code.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Membership System</td>
					<td>It will require the team to learn SQL and PHP, which will take some time to learn</td>
					<td>Research for the membership system should be quite short as there are many sites we can reference on for what we need to include </td>
					<td>It requires a large amount of time but it is not complicated as most of the information is quite generalised</td>
					<td>Coding will take a while, there will be a lot of error handling and full stack development for it</td>
					<td>Testing the membership may take a while due to its variety of error possibilities</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Pantry Recipe Maker</td>
					<td>This may take a while, as it will involve learning code and understanding what goes into recipes</td>
					<td>The pantry recipe maker may take lot of research, particually finding out what recipes are needed and all their ingredients.</td>
					<td>This may take a while to design as there are many approaches to design the function</td>
					<td>Coding will take time, the connection to the database and functionality will be quite heavily coded</td>
					<td>Testing the review section would rely on the membership system working, otherwise shouldnt take too long.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Review</td>
					<td>Learning will require a lot of time, mainly to learn SQL and PHP </td>
					<td>The research part shouldn't take long as the content is quite straightforward and doesn't involve much other than common knowledge</td>
					<td>Designing the review section would be quite straight forward as everyone would be familiar with how reviews would look</td>
					<td>This shouldn't take long to code, depending on how it's built. Even if it does need to talk to a databse, it's quite minimal.</td>
					<td>Testing the review section would rely on the membership system working, otherwise shouldn't take too long.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>My Cookbook</td>
					<td>My cookbook shouldn't take much time learning as the content is filled by the user</td>
					<td>Research shouldn't take too long, the team will have an understanding of linking databases by this point.</td>
					<td>Design of the cookbook will take time, the content is set by the user and needs to be adaptable</td>
					<td>Coding of this section will take time, it will need to talk to the database and be implemented into each page</td>
					<td>Testing will be long as each recipe needs to be checked.</td>
				</tr>	
				<tr>
					<td>Ingredient Scale</td>
					<td>The incredient scale may take a while depending on how much SQL and PHP is needed to be learnt</td>
					<td>Researching would be quick due to the content being minimal</td>
					<td>The design shouldn't take much effort, it will fit into the already designed recipe pages</td>
					<td>Coding may take a while due to the sheer number of entries required</td>
					<td>All testing will entail cross checking the ingredient result with a calculator</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Image Section</td>
					<td>This section will require minimal learning, other than maybe minor javscript to handle transitions.</td>
					<td>Research will take a while as mini recipies will need to be researched and created</td>
					<td>The design of this section may take some time due to the many images needed to be layed out</td>
					<td>This section shouldn't take too long as the bulk of it is in CSS</td>
					<td>Testing this section will mainly consist of looking at it with different browser resolution sizes</td>
