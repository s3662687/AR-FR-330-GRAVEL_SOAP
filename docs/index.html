            Kyle Wilkinson - s3836778 <br>
            <b>Background: </b>I am from regional Victoria and now reside in Melbourne, I work part time as a Paint Expert and study part time. I enjoy building things in quite a generalised sense which I believe is where my passion for IT stems from. I spend a lot of my building recycled furniture and have decided to push my need to create into IT where my potential is limited only by my own motivation.<br>
           	<b>Interests: </b>I believe I am generally quite competent in the design of things, taking a lot of care into the potential aesthetic pleasure of things. I have some experience in a variety of areas into IT including: HTML, CSS, SQL, C, Visual Basic and JAVA.<br>
            <b>Weakness: </b>My biggest weakness would be beginning a task and then persisting with said task without getting distracted by another interesting task and inevitably overwhelming myself, leaving nothing but half started tasks.<br>
            <b>Role: </b> I’m looking at being the lead designer and focusing on the membership management system which will involve learning and implementing PHP and SQL<br>

            <b>Background: </b>I’m from melbourne and i’m currently studying a degree in IT. This is my 3rd Year at RMIT having completed a diploma of business. I have some experience in Java and mySQL having studied them in previous semesters.<br>
           	<b>Interests: </b>My interests in IT, specifically programming, stems from playing video games throughout most of my life. I am comfortable with Java and alright with HTML. <br>
			<b>Weakness: </b>In terms of this project, my biggest weakness would be web design as i’m not a creative/artsy person.</b>
            <b>Role: </b> Writing PHP and maybe mySQL.<br>

            Trung Hieu Dang - s3789396<br>
            <b>Background: </b>I came from Vietnam and have been studying abroad at RMIT since mid 2019. In Vietnam, I have learned a bit of  c++ and Java programming language and after a year at RMIT, I have finished a Java course and in the middle of a web programming course.<br>
           	<b>Interests: </b>I played several games when I was a kid but after a few years I felt bored of games and didn’t play much. But I am still curious about how games are made and want to know more about IT careers. <br>
			<b>Weakness: </b>I'm a quiet person and not confident with my speaking so I didn’t talk much during the meeting, but I will try to contribute as much as I can in this project.</b>
            <b>Role: </b>I’m in the middle of a web programming course so I hope I can have tasks related to html, css and Javascript.<br>

			<b>Weakness: </b>My weakness for this project is my time-management when given multiple tasks to complete, I allocate a lot of time to tasks that require priority and use the little time I have to the other task.</b>
            <b>Role: </b> Writing PHP and mySQL<br>
