            Kyle Wilkinson - s3836778 <br>
            <b>Background: </b>I am from regional Victoria and now reside in Melbourne, I work part time as a Paint Expert and study part time. I enjoy building things in quite a generalised sense which I believe is where my passion for IT stems from. I spend a lot of my building recycled furniture and have decided to push my need to create into IT where my potential is limited only by my own motivation.<br>
           	<b>Interests: </b>I believe I am generally quite competent in the design of things, taking a lot of care into the potential aesthetic pleasure of things. I have some experience in a variety of areas into IT including: HTML, CSS, SQL, C, Visual Basic and JAVA.<br>
            <b>Weakness: </b>My biggest weakness would be beginning a task and then persisting with said task without getting distracted by another interesting task and inevitably overwhelming myself, leaving nothing but half started tasks.<br>
            <b>Role: </b> I’m looking at being the lead designer and focusing on the membership management system which will involve learning and implementing PHP and SQL<br>

           	<b>Interests: </b>I love learning and creating. My main hobbies include reading, drawing, writing, and playing online games with my friends. At least when i'm not procrastinating with Netflix.<br>
			<b>Weakness: </b>Zero experience with PHP and little experience with Javascript. Only 1 semester of real experience in IT in general.<br>
            <b>Role: </b> Writing HTML and possibly CSS. Managing AWS and webpages.<br>

           	<b>Interests: </b>My interests in IT, specifically programming, stems from playing video games throughout most of my life. I am comfortable with Java and alright with HTML. <br>
			<b>Weakness: </b>In terms of this project, my biggest weakness would be web design as i’m not a creative/artsy person.<br>

            <b>Background: </b>I came from Vietnam and have been studying abroad at RMIT since mid 2019. In Vietnam, I have learned a bit of  c++ and Java programming language and after a year at RMIT, I have finished a Java course and in the middle of a web programming course.<br>
           	<b>Interests: </b>I played several games when I was a kid but after a few years I felt bored of games and didn’t play much. But I am still curious about how games are made and want to know more about IT careers. <br>
			<b>Weakness: </b>I'm a quiet person and not confident with my speaking so I didn’t talk much during the meeting, but I will try to contribute as much as I can in this project.<br>
            <b>Role: </b>I’m in the middle of a web programming course so I hope I can have tasks related to html, css and Javascript.<br>

        <h2>Project Motivation</h2>
		<p><b>Group:</b></p>
		<p>Some of the members have to prepare food for themselves so cooking is one of our common things. Several students, after enrolling in a university, didn't have any experience in cooking or didn't know many recipes for their meal. With that bare in mind, we think we can create a website to serve this purpose, to help these freshman with easy recipes, short tips in the kitchen and tutorial videos.</p>
        <p><u>Richard: </u>I’m interested in learning PHP </p>
		<p><u></u></p>
		<p><u>Thanh: </u>My motivation is to learn more about PHP and revise on mySQL.
</p>
		<p><u>Trung Hieu Dang: </u>i’m currently in the web programming course so this might be a good chance to learn from others.
</p>
		<p><u>Kyle: </u>I am interested in learning how to use multiple programming languages together and how to connect databases to websites.

        <h2>Project Justification</h2>

        <h3>Workload</h3>
        <p>It is expected for a group member to have a workload of minimum of 5 hours/week, ideally 10 hours/week. </p>

        <h3>Beryound Capable Capabilities</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Our recipe database will not be content heavy.</li>
            <li>Membership system that require learning PHP.</li>
            <li>The VR feature is still new for us all and the hardware to test it is absent.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Risks</h3>
        <p>
            <b>Risks:</b> Lack of experience with different languages which can impact the end result <br>
            <b>Example:</b> <br>
            <b>Mitigation:</b> <br>
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Risks:</b> As a group we may design a feature that works on paper, but when we actually at
            tempt to implement the feature it proves out of our expertise and too difficult due to knowledge and time restraints <br>
            <b>Example:</b> <br>
            <b>Mitigation:</b> <br>
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Risks:</b> There are several recipe websites on the internet so it is quite hard to compete with them because those with huge knowledge in IT have already created it and improved its feature. And we do not know how to promote our product on the internet. Therefore our website might not be welcome in the first few releases.
            <br>
