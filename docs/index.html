            Kyle Wilkinson - s3836778 <br>
            <b>Background: </b>I am from regional Victoria and now reside in Melbourne, I work part time as a Paint Expert and study part time. I enjoy building things in quite a generalised sense which I believe is where my passion for IT stems from. I spend a lot of my building recycled furniture and have decided to push my need to create into IT where my potential is limited only by my own motivation.<br>
           	<b>Interests: </b>I believe I am generally quite competent in the design of things, taking a lot of care into the potential aesthetic pleasure of things. I have some experience in a variety of areas into IT including: HTML, CSS, SQL, C, Visual Basic and JAVA.<br>
            <b>Weakness: </b>My biggest weakness would be beginning a task and then persisting with said task without getting distracted by another interesting task and inevitably overwhelming myself, leaving nothing but half started tasks.<br>
            <b>Role: </b> I’m looking at being the lead designer and focusing on the membership management system which will involve learning and implementing PHP and SQL<br>

        <h2>Projecct Description</h2>
        <p>This project will provide a website focusing on information based on cooking-based skills and recipes. The target audience we are catering to are students/clients who have introductory-level cooking skills and are on a budget. Many students who do live without their parents or clients who are not skillful in cooking are afraid, do not have the time or have the budget to cook daily are dependent on easy-made/frozen meals, fast food or food delivery businesses such as Ubereats. The idea is to offer these clients the basic culinary skills needed to cook simple, delicious and healthy dishes that is quick to prepare and bang-for-the-buck. This website will feature a few extra functions to make the experience for the user easier and more enjoyable such as membership features and a pantry recipe maker.

        <h2>Project Motivation</h2>
		<p><b>Group:</b></p>
		<p>Some of the members have to prepare food for themselves so cooking is one of our common things. Several students, after enrolling in a university, didn't have any experience in cooking or didn't know many recipes for their meal. With that bare in mind, we think we can create a website to serve this purpose, to help these freshman with easy recipes, short tips in the kitchen and tutorial videos.</p>
       
		<p><u>Richard: </u>I am interested in learning PHP and want to learn more about backend development</p>
		<p><u>Thanh: </u>My motivation is to learn more about PHP and revise on mySQL.
</p>
		<p><u>Trung Hieu Dang: </u>i’m currently in the web programming course so this might be a good chance to learn from others.
</p>
		<p><u>Kyle: </u>I am interested in learning how to use multiple programming languages together and how to connect databases to websites.
</p>
		<p><u>Robert: </u> I am interested in learning the more complex properties of HTML and learning more about CSS and Javascript.

            <dt><u><i>2. Validation Test</i></u></dt>
            <dd>Perform unit testing to each of the different functions within the membership registration page. This includes the input error checking, button function, inputs, review function and the database which the memberships are compiled and stored. Once unit testing is completed, user testing will be conducted via teams. The participant will be given a scenario of a user wanting to create an account to leave a review on a specific recipe in a given time. Once the scenario is finished, a series of questions will be asked to the participant of the user experience, usability and the pros and cons of the website.</dd>
        <br>

        <!--Feature 4-->
            <dt><u><i>1. Review system</i></u></dt>
            <dd>Users will have the option of leaving a rating and/or review of each dish. The rating feature will be using a 5 star rating systems with increments of half stars, these rating are then displayed as an average associated with each dish. The review function will allow the user to submit a review of 280 characters or less. The character limit is to allow other users to quickly read through each review. The ratings of a dish can be used to filter certain scores in or out of a search.</dd>
            <dt><u><i>2. Validation Test</i></u></dt>
            <dd>User testing with scenarios which represent a user’s needs, objectives and the journey towards their objective. In this case, to use a review or to filter out reviews to find specific ratings or popularity of reviews. The scenario will be timed and the participants will be asked a series of questions regarding the journey towards reaching their objective. This will also give more information towards reliability and usability testing.</dd>

        <br>

        <!--Feature 4-->
            <dt><u><i>1. Pantry recipe maker</i></u></dt>
            <dd>Users can insert (or select) which ingredients they have available. The website will then find a recipe that requires only those ingredients 
                that make, filtering out any recipes that require unavailable ingredients.</dd>
            <dt><u><i>2. Validation Test</i></u></dt>
            <dd>Unit testing of specific functions of the pantry recipe maker to make sure they all work within the website. The selection function, recipe compiler and recipe filter system will all be specifically tested by using mock recipes and input ingredients. If the specific mock recipe is presented, the unit test is deemed successful.</dd>

        </dl>

        <h3>Extended Feature</h3>
        <dl>
        <!--Extended Feature 1-->
            <dt><u><i>1. My Cookbook</i></u></dt>

            <dt><u><i>2. Validation Test</i></u></dt>

            <dd>A testing table will be used with mock recipies. Predictions will be made on what should be output depending on a certain scale, if the predictions matcht he actual 
                outcomes, testing wil be considered successful.</dd>

        <br>

            <dd>Unit testing is required, ensuring that only a member can only save and post their images. using a mock account in the database, 
                programmers can test the save function and image input function. If a visitor without an account can access this function, the 
                code is deemed bugged and requires amendment. </dd>
        </dl>

        <h2>Project Justification</h2>

        <h3>Workload</h3>
        <p>It is expected for a group member to have a workload of minimum of 5 hours/week, ideally 10 hours/week. </p>

        <h3>Beryound Capable Capabilities</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Our recipe database will not be content heavy.</li>
            <li>Membership system that require learning PHP.</li>
            <li>The VR feature is still new for us all and the hardware to test it is absent.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Risks</h3>
        <p>
            <b>Risks:</b> Lack of experience with different languages which can impact the end result <br>
            <b>Example:</b> <br>
            <b>Mitigation:</b> <br>
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Risks:</b> As a group we may design a feature that works on paper, but when we actually at
            tempt to implement the feature it proves out of our expertise and too difficult due to knowledge and time restraints <br>
            <b>Example:</b> <br>
            <b>Mitigation:</b> <br>
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Risks:</b> There are several recipe websites on the internet so it is quite hard to compete with them because those with huge knowledge in IT have already created it and improved its feature. And we do not know how to promote our product on the internet. Therefore our website might not be welcome in the first few releases.
            <br>
            <b>Example:</b> <br>
            <b>Mitigation:</b> <br>
