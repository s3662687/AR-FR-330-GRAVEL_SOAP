					<td>Image Section</td>
					<td>The images section will likely incorporate database knowledge for which I have little experience. It will take a lot of time to learn how to incorporate the images section in this way.</td>
					<td>I have limited knowledge on databases and SQL and will require extensive research to plan how I will construct the Images section.</td>
					<td>Designing the Images section so that it is aesthetically pleasing will take some time.</td>
					<td>Heavy use of CSS, HTML, and database languages will be needed to create a funtional Image section, as well as the ability to upload images to the website.</td>
					<td>Testing that all Images upload and apear as intended will take some time, as well testing the database funtions as intented.</td>

				<tr>
					<td>Search Function</td>
					<td>Lack of experience with PHP and MySQL means learning it from scratch. Have basic undertsanding of HTML and CSS. </td>
					<td>It wont take too long as the search function itself isn't too complex, will need to research on how to link to the database. </td>
					<td>Simplistic design for the search bar and the result page will also be fairly simple. </td>
					<td>The final code probably wont be too big, alot of time will spent figuring out how to make it work(i.e. testing and re-coding). </td>
					<td>Tesing will mostly be done by prototyping via XAMPP(as a local host) and running it on a browser which isn't too time consuming. </td>
				</tr>
				
				<tr>
					<td>Introduction Tutorial</td>
					<td>Since majority of it is HTML and CSS, there wont be too much learning needed. </td>
					<td>Some research will be spent finding images. </td>
					<td>Making and editing videos can be time consuming</td>
					<td>Still require to code the webpages but other then that not too much coding</td>
					<td>Some time might be spent editing/testing videos, not much time will be spent on testing coding.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Membership System</td>
					<td>Has experience with MySQL, CSS and HTML but lack of experience with  PHP so will still require a bit of learning</td>
					<td>Mostly going to check out other website as reference on how to make a login/register </td>
					<td>It requires a large amount of time but it is not complicated as most of the information is quite generalised</td>
					<td>it will be intensive as it will require form validation, error handling and quite abit of functions and queries</td>
					<td>prototyping can easily be done if using XAMPP(to locaL host) and any web browser</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Pantry Recipe Maker</td>
					<td>Lack of experience with PHP and MySQL will require sometime to learn. Has experience with HTML and CSS.</td>
					<td>Alot of time will be spent finding recipes and their ingreidents.</td>
					<td>Login and Registration page will require some designing </td>
					<td>Coding will take time, will require to quite abit functions and MySQL query </td>
					<td>Prototyping can easily be done if using XAMPP(to locaL host) and any web browser.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Review</td>
					<td>Need to learn basic PHP and MySQL </td>
					<td>Does't require too much research as its quite straightword and small content wise.</td>
					<td>Simple design for review comments and ratings, no neeed to make a webpage so not as time consuming</td>
					<td>Will require abit of coding in PHP and MySQL but overall not very intensive</td>
					<td>Tesing can eaily be done be hosting on XAMPP and using any web browser</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>My Cookbook</td>
					<td>This is more focus on the user(i.e.saving recipes), will require learning some PHP and MySQL</td>
					<td>Mostly on research on how to link to database.</td>
					<td>It needs to be made adaptable as it will need change for each user</td>
					<td>will require PHP code to talk to the database but overall not too intensive</td>
					<td>testing can easily be done but also time consuming as it's testing all the entries</td>
				</tr>	
				<tr>
					<td>Ingredient Scale</td>
					<td>It mostly going to be PHP and very little on MySQL</td>
					<td>won't require too much research as it's focus on the quantity rather than the actual ingredient.</td>
					<td>Barely any design work as it mostly dealing with fonts and positioning</td>
					<td>the code itself isn't too big, it will require making couple of functions</td>
					<td>There not too much to test and it can easily be done.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Image Section</td>
					<td>Require some knowledge of advanced PHP, basic CSS and basic MySQL.</td>
					<td>Alot of research will be getting relevent images. </td>
					<td>Will need to be more complex the other features as it specificially deal with images. </td>
					<td>Will be quite intensive on PHP and CSS. </td>
					<td>Fairly easy to test like other features.</td>
